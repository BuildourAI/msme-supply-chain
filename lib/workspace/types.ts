/**
 * A workspace is one company's own data.
 *
 * Every figure in this build is computed from a `SeedBundle`
 * (`lib/domain/derive.ts`), so an owner's company is simply another source of
 * that bundle — empty on the day they sign in, filled by the set-up steps. The
 * demo company keeps its seed and becomes the sample workspace, which is why
 * none of the derivations, formulas or guardrails change to support this.
 *
 * The domain types are left exactly as they are. Two things the owner
 * customises — what they call a kind of supplier, and what they call a group of
 * materials — have no field on `Vendor` or `Item`, and inventing one would
 * change types the reconciliation suites pin. They live here instead, as
 * side-tables keyed by id, which is also the honest shape: they are this
 * company's vocabulary, not a property of the material itself.

 * `lib/domain/types.ts` because that file's shapes are pinned by the
 * reconciliation suites, and nothing here has any business changing them.
 *
 * They are joined but not enforced into a funnel. Every small firm in the
 * source set quotes on WhatsApp, so an owner who never raises a request must
 * still be able to record a quote, and somebody who already knows the price
 * must still be able to raise an order. A system that refuses the way people
 * actually work is a system they keep a parallel notebook for.
